Title: "World Happiness Dashboard (2015–2019)"

Overview: The dataset used for this dashboard is the World Happiness Report for the years 2015–2019. It contains annual data for countries worldwide, including indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

I chose this dataset because it provides a quantitative view of well-being across the globe and allows for interesting comparisons between countries, trends over time, and correlations between happiness and socio-economic factors.

Data Cleaning: Combining multiple years: The reports for each year were in separate files, so they were merged into a single dataset for easier comparison.

Handling missing values: Some countries lacked data in certain years or indicators. Missing values were either imputed using averages or removed, depending on the context, to ensure accurate analysis.

Standardization: Column names and formats were standardized across years for consistency.

Insights: 
Nordic countries consistently rank highest in happiness, with Finland, Denmark, and Norway leading.

GDP per capita strongly correlates with happiness scores, indicating wealthier nations tend to report higher well-being.

Perceptions of corruption are negatively related to happiness. Countries with higher corruption scores often have lower happiness ratings.

Social support and life expectancy are also key contributors to happiness across nations.


How to Use: The dashboard is available as a .twbx file, which can be opened in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.

Users can interact with filters for year, region, and indicators to explore trends and relationships.

All visualizations are fully interactive: hover for details, click to highlight, and use filters for comparisons.
